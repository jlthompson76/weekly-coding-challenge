## Week #2 - Looping a Pattern

Start Date: March 18, 2020
End Date: March 25, 2020

_Challenge Description from Moodle:_

### Looping a Pattern

Write a JavaScript program to construct the following pattern, using a nested for loop.

```
*  
* *  
* * *  
* * * *  
* * * * *
```
HINT: You will need to nest a for loop inside of a for loop.

Here is a flowchart to help you:

#### Challenge Description

_Provide the challenge description here in your own words_

For this challenge, we had to recreate a pattern containing alternating asterisks and spaces, with one asterisk on the first line, two on the second line, three on the third line, four on the fourth line, and five on the fifth line.

#### Explain your solution

_Explain how you came up with the solution. What did you use to solve the problem?_

For this challenge, I knew from the description in Moodle that I needed to use a nested for loop. A flowchart was also provided, which was helpful once I figured out how to read it. I started solving the problem by entering the script for a basic for loop into my JavaScript file, then added information based on the flowchart (for example, I knew that my variables would be x, y, and char, and that x <= 6, etc.).

Once I laid the foundation, I used trial and error to make sure I was putting the nested for loop in the correct place. Initially I was getting error messages (i.e., variable was undefined), so I spent time debugging the script and trying different things.

Eventually I was able to recreate the pattern, which made me happy as at first I didn't know if I'd be able to finish it by the deadline or not. (Since I didn't see the challenge posted on Moodle when I checked after class on Wednesday evening and devoted most of the week to working on the "My Pothole Website" project, I forgot to complete the challenge until right before claass, so I only had a short amount of time to get it done!)

#### What are you thoughts about this challenge? Did you like it?

Yes, I did like the challenge, and I thought this week's challenge was more challenging than last week's. While I understand the concept of loops, I have struggled at times with getting them to work correctly in some of the class exercises and assignments we've done, so I appreciated the opportunity to be challenged and spend more time on loops.

#### What have you learned from it?

I learned more about how to construct for loops and get them to work correctly. Before working on this challenge, I don't think I had used a nested for loop before, so this was something new for me to learn and implement. Also, I'd like to continue working on this to turn it into a function and have the final iteration of the loop (resulting in the full pattern with all five rows) be displayed on the HTML page.
